ABSTRACT
The SINS CipherSec tool is a password management system designed to help users secure their online accounts by generating strong, unique passwords, checking their strength, and storing them in a secure manner. The tool includes a password generator that uses a combination of random character generation and rules to ensure a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, the tool includes a password strength assessment feature that measures the strength of a given password by counting the number of characters, the mix of character types, and whether or not the password appears in a list of commonly used passwords. The tool also provides a secure storage feature that encrypts the passwords before storing them, and only allows the user to access them after proper authentication. The user interface is designed to be easy to use, allowing users to easily generate new passwords, check the strength of their current passwords, and securely store their passwords. Overall, the SINS CipherSec tool provides users with a comprehensive and secure solution for managing their online account passwords.
Introduction
The SINS CipherSec tool is a powerful password management solution that aims to keep users' online accounts secure by providing them with strong, unique and unbreakable passwords. The tool has a user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of password generation, strength assessment and secure storage. The password generator uses advanced algorithms to create passwords that are difficult to crack, by combining random characters, numbers, and symbols. The tool also includes a password strength checker that evaluates the strength of the entered password and suggests improvements if needed. The passwords are then encrypted and stored in a secure manner, accessible only to the user via proper authentication. The tool also offers the option to check the strength of the password through both command-line interface and graphical user interface as well as generating password in both ways. The tool also uses user's name and password phrase to make the password more memorable. Overall, the SINS CipherSec tool is a reliable and efficient solution that helps users keep their online accounts safe and secure.
Key Features
The key features of the Password Checker are:
1.	Displaying an ASCII art logo from a randomly chosen file in a randomly chosen color from the 'logo' directory
2.	Presenting a user-friendly menu with 4 options to choose from:
•	Check password strength using command line interface
•	Check password strength using graphical user interface
•	Generate unbreakable password using command line interface
•	Generate unbreakable password using graphical user interface
3.	Running different python scripts from the 'script-main' directory based on the user's choice
4.	Using subprocess.call() to run other python scripts
5.	Using os.path.abspath() and os.path.dirname() method to get the current directory of the script and then join the directory name to form the relative path to the desired directory.
6.	Using input() method to take user's choice and then it runs the relevant script by passing the command to run the script via subprocess.call() method.
7.	Using glob and random module to randomly choose the logo file from the logo directory and choose random color from predefined list of colors.
8.	Using termcolor module to print the contents of the chosen file in a randomly chosen color.
9.	Using if-elif block to check user's choice and based on that it runs the relevant python script.
Overall, the script serves as a starting point for the SINS CipherSec tool and allows the user to access the different features of the tool, such as password generation and strength assessment, through a user-friendly menu and also it provide the security to the passwords by running the scripts in subprocess.

The key features of the Password Generator are:

1.	It takes user input for name and password phrase.
2.	It creates arrays of different character types: digits, lowercase characters, uppercase characters, and symbols.
3.	It uses the random.choice() method to randomly select at least one character from each character set.
4.	It uses a for loop to fill the rest of the password length by selecting randomly from the combined list of characters.
5.	It uses the array module to convert the temporary password into an array and shuffle it to prevent it from having a consistent pattern.
6.	It combines all the words and append the characters to form the password using a for loop.
7.	It prints out the final password.
8.	It ensures that the final password contains at least one character from each set of characters.
9.	It uses combination of user's name and password phrase to create the final password.
Overall, the program is designed to generate a strong password that meets certain security requirements, such as including a mix of character types and using a combination of user's name and phrase to make the password more memorable.

Methodology
•	Understand the problem: Gather information on the current state of password management and the problems users face when trying to create and manage strong, unique passwords.
•	Research existing solutions: Review existing password management tools and technologies to understand their features and capabilities, and to identify any gaps or areas for improvement.
•	Design the tool: Develop a detailed design for the tool, including the user interface, the algorithms for password generation and assessment, and the methods for secure storage.
•	Implement the tool: Use a programming language such as Python, Java or C#, to implement the tool based on the design. Use libraries and frameworks that are appropriate for the problem domain such as PyPassLib, passlib, zxcvbn and more.
•	Test the tool: Use a combination of manual and automated testing to ensure that the tool is functional, user-friendly, and secure.Evaluate the tool: Gather feedback from users and evaluate the tool's performance and effectiveness. Use metrics such as time taken to generate the password, password strength, ease of use and security of the tool.
•	Improve the tool: Use the feedback and evaluation results to make improvements and bug fixes to the tool.
•	Deploy and maintain the tool: Deploy the tool to a server or hosting service and provide maintenance and support to ensure that it continues to function effectively over time.

Algorithm for the SINS CipherSec tool
1.	Start the program and display the ASCII art logo.
2.	Present the user with a menu of options, including:
•	Check password strength (CLI/GUI)
•	Generate a new password (CLI/GUI)
•	Securely store passwords
•	Exit the program
3.	Take input from the user to select an option.
4.	If the user chooses to check password strength:
•	Prompt the user to enter a password
•	Check the strength of the password using the password strength assessment module.
•	If the password is strong, display a message indicating so.
•	If the password is weak, display a message indicating so and suggest improvements.
5.	If the user chooses to generate a new password:
•	Use the password generation module to create a new password
•	Display the new password to the user.
